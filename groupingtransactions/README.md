# Wanderlog Assessment: Grouping Transactions by Items' Names

## Problem Statement
For a given array of transactions, group all of the transactions by item name. Return an array of strings where each string contains the item name followed by a space and the number of associated transactions.

**Note:** Sort the array descending by transaction count, then ascending alphabetically by item name for items with matching transaction counts.

---

## Example
```
transactions = ['notebook', 'notebook', 'mouse', 'keyboard', 'mouse']
```
There are two items with 2 transactions each: 'notebook' and 'mouse'. In alphabetical order, they are 'mouse', 'notebook'.

There is one item with 1 transaction: 'keyboard'.

The return array, sorted as required, is:
```
['mouse 2', 'notebook 2', 'keyboard 1']
```

---

Complete the function `groupTransactions` in the editor below.

**groupTransactions** has the following parameter(s):
- `string transactions[n]`: each `transactions[i]` denotes the item name in the i-th transaction

**Returns:**
- `string[]`: an array of strings of "item name[space]transaction count" sorted as described

---

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5^
- 1 ≤ length of transactions[i] ≤ 10
- transactions[i] contains only lowercase English letters, ascii[a-z]

---

## Input Format for Custom Testing
Input from stdin will be processed as follows and passed to the function.
- The first line contains a single integer, n, the size of transactions.
- Each of the next n lines contains a string, the item name for transactions[i].
